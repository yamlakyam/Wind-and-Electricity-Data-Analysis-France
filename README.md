# Wind-and-Electricity-Data-Analysis-France
This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks focused on data analysis of wind generation and historical data analysis for France, 
specifically examining weather patterns and electricity consumption. The notebooks provide insights and visualizations based on the available data, 
allowing for a better understanding of wind generation trends and the relationship between weather conditions and electricity demand in France.

Notebooks

Wind_Generation_Analysis.ipynb: This notebook explores wind generation data, examining its patterns, trends, and factors affecting its variability. 
It includes visualizations such as time series plots, histograms, and correlation analysis to gain insights into the wind generation patterns.

Historical_Data_Analysis.ipynb: This notebook focuses on the historical data analysis for France, considering both weather and electricity consumption.
It explores the relationship between weather variables (e.g., temperature, precipitation) and electricity demand, providing visualizations and statistical 
analysis to uncover any potential correlations or patterns.
